# Commodore-64-mainboard-layouts

Chip and component layouts for each of the known Commodore 64 mainboards

## Why?

Uh, why not? No, really: why isn't there a digital map of these things by this point? Every other manual and guide element has been scanned and digitized by now, but we're still working with scans of the original hand-drawn maps or old flat images created from them.

Time to get this stuff up into the modern era so we can actually get down and dirty with our mods and repair efforts on these beloved old machines!

## What?

This is literally a dumping spot for the sources and final products of my effort to make fully digital versions of the C64 mainboards' layouts.  Not full schematics or anything on that level, this is just a component map so one can find where that fabled "R24" resistor slot might be, or which chip is _really_ U21 on this particular board revision?
This project only really gained a sense of direction, thanks to the [Commodore Repair Toolbox](https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Commodore-Repair-Toolbox)!
