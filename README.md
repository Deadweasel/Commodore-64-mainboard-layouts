# Commodore-64-mainboard-layouts

Chip and component layouts for each of the known Commodore 64 mainboards

## Why?

Uh, why not? No, really: why isn't there a digital map of these things by this point? Every other manual and guide element has been scanned and digitized by now, but we're still working with scans of the original hand-drawn maps or old flat images created from them.

Time to get this stuff up into the modern era so we can actually get down and dirty with our mods and repair efforts on these beloved old machines!
